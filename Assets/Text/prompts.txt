The team lead has reported that all of their teammates have ghosted on the game project. Despite the efforts of the team lead in trying to corral the students on his team, the wayward children have decided that they were unaware of the potential work that the project entailed or were unaware of the true nature of their college workload as STEM majors. It is also apparent to you that there is a demon on earth who is the computer science professor, which all freshman are required to take as required course. As leader of the club, you decision is to:
One of the members on the team has reported that they have mutinied and no longer want to work for their old tyrannical team lead. Despite your personal trust in the newfound commitment by the team members after overthrowing their old team lead, it may not be in the best interest of the club to sponsor a team which has essentially broken club policy in order to do what they felt like was correct on a random whim rather than reforming the team through the official avenues. As the club leader, you decide to:
The team lead has reported that their team has split into two factions regarding the direction which they want to approach the design for the game. The two factions which exist on the team are the Reds and the Whites. The Whites insist that the correct choice is to focus and optimize on gameplay, whereas the Reds insist that the correct choice is to focus on the creative direction of the game. As leader of the club, you decide to:
The team lead has reported that everything is fine with their team. Well, almost everything, as it only excludes a certain team member. Everyone else seems to be working fine and creating and producing assets according to schedule, but it seems that the certain team member has been unable to complete work or attend meetings because their mother, father, sister, brother, grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, dog, cat, their laptop, and their desktop have passed away within the short time span which the team member has stopped being productive. As the club leader, you decide to:
The officer companion for the team has reported that they seem to have dropped off of the face of the Earth and no longer are communicating through any social media that was set up. The officer companion has scoured the entire internet for any traces of this team in any capacity, but to no avail. Fortunately, you do have the contact information which you required on the sign-up forms for the game projects. As the leader of the club, you decide to:
The team members have reported that their team lead has executed the most amazing magic trick known to mankind as he has mysteriously disappeared from any point of contact, whether it is online or face to face. The officer companion has been trying to reach the team lead in question, but it seems that an AI uprising is a potential danger given how many times the officer companion and the team lead has tried to contact the team lead. As the wise leader of this club, you decide to:
The team lead has reported that they are unclear on how to design, program, write, draw, or compose, or how to produce a game. In fact, are they even clear on what the definition of a game is conceptually? Is a game just artificial conflict that players engage in to reach a quantifiable outcome or is it simply an pleasurable activity that has rules? Are games simply a medium which other media reside to create an interactive experience which emulates the agency that humans seek in their lives which perhaps doesn’t truly exist? Ignoring the extremely heady philosophical arguments regarding games, as the club leader, you decide to:
It is a very dark and very stormy night that the team lead on a certain team has reported that their writer has decided to be the next Edward Bulwer-Lytton and has insisted upon extremely and completely unnecessarily verbose language and insists that an entire essay must be constructed for each discrete scene within the game, as the pen is certainly mightier than the sword in game design. You’re quite sure the last sentence that you read from the writer was a run-on sentence. It is noted that the writer now has eternal writer’s block due to the unnecessary extra work which they assigned themselves for. As the club leader, you decide to:
The team lead has reported that their artist has managed to hit a creative block in attempts of becoming the “Agnes Martin” of game art. Art officers have warned the artist of the nuances of game art and the fallacy of the simplicity of game art, but the artist on the team now has figured out that minimalistic game art isn’t simply just a collection of fabricated objects which are magically pre-rendered with the help of drawing software. As leader of the club, you decide to:
The team lead reports that the writer seems to be finished with their writing. They try to emulate the minimalism of Ernest Hemingway, and they seem to largely succeed at the task. There seems to be no additional tasks which the writer needs to finish. As club leader, you:
The team lead has reported that the artist has managed to finish all the art assets for their project, as the artist seemed to be on the level of Pablo Picasso. The artist, having nothing else to do, seems to be experimenting with cubes of various colors to create a collage or a sculpture of some sort in the game engine which the team is developing in. As the club leader, you decide to:
Let me tell you a tale, a scary tale which you should learn from. There once was this team. This team did not heed the wisdom of the officers. The gospel from the gaming development gods state that they had created this world of game development by properly scoping, and all was good with the world. This team, however, decided to ignore the gods and began to implement features beyond what they could actually produce. Their arrogance and lack of awareness had now placed them in a state which they could not finish their game. Though it may seem to you as just a fantastical tale, it exists within our reality. As the club leader, you decide to:
A team lead reports that they can’t seem to be able to schedule team meetings that work with everyone’s time. Everyone seems to have other homework, classes, and midterms at completely separate times. It’s almost a miracle how none of the team’s schedule ever coincides. There’s no way that this could be just a coincidence right? As the club leader, you decide to:
From the masses, only the the resilient remain. They have struggled, labored, and have poured their sweat and their souls into the final product that is a working prototype. It certainly may not be the most elegant work that they have produced in their entire lifetime, but it’s their work that they managed to finish on time, goddamnit. The achievement isn’t being able to claim that it is your finest work, rather it’s the pride that the creators are entitled to after creating something that works and can now truly be considered something akin to a game. As a club leader, you decide to:
A programmer from the team comes up to you to ask about how to program an isometric story-driven RPG with extensive shader work needed for the graphics as well as the need for online multiplayer with pseudo-random terrain and mob generation. After you process all of the buzzwords using your shell-shocked mind, as the club leader, you decide to:
A team lead comes into the club room with a major problem. Every time that their team meets, they manage to somehow add an additional mechanic that they somehow decided was necessary for their game. Maybe it was just purely based on how cool it would possibly be, maybe it was necessary for another mechanic or aesthetic implementation. It doesn’t matter. The addiction to continually add more features and more complexity to the game seems to be a habit or addiction which the team can’t break, as it “just feels so good”. As the club leader, you decide to:
